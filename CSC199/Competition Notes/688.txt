Score: 0 points (Around 135 points)

I was able to solve the first problem in about 25 minutes, but that's all I could complete.
Unfortunately, after pasting my solution to TopCoder from my IDE and submitting it,
the website claimed that my submission was blank, so I got 0 points after the testing phase.
It awarded me around 135 points for the of submission, however.
