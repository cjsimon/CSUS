I didn't make it on time for registration; however, I participated in the contest with another classmate who signed in on time.
Together, we got the first problem and were able to pass all the test cases for 250pts.
We ran out of time while attempting to figure out the second problem.
For the second problem, we considered brute force at first, but then thought that there were too many combinations to iterate through.
So we brainstormed about trying to pick a pattern size, n, within the set, check through all patterns of that size, and try to deduce whether to check for a pattern size greater or less than n, depending on whether we got a match or not.
In the long run, we ran out of time before coding up a solution to the problem, though we wouldn't have gotten too far before realizing that our solution wouldn't work.
