We form a word using only A's, B's and C's.
Suppose we can never have an A next to a C.
Develop an algorithm that computes the number of n-letter words that can be formed.

Deliverables:
1. Write a dynamic-programming based algorithm that includes:
- Defining variables
- Developing recursive functions
- Building a table for finding the number of 8-letter words that can be formed

2. Translate the algorithm into a Java program that computes the number of n-letter words.
