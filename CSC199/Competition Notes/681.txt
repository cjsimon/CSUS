Score: 50
I got my code for IdentifyingWood to past all the test cases
locally on my computer in 15 minutes, however when submitting
the program on topcoder, all test cases failed - The compiler
indicated that my class had to be declared 'public', so I
wasn't awarded any points. On the bright side, I did challenge
another user's solution and found a test case that broke their
code, so I got 50 points for that.

When attempting the second problem, ExplodingRobots, after thinking
about it for about 30 minutes, I thought of solving the problem by
only attempting to execute the robot instructions only if it made them
closer to each other. I though about doing this by checking all four
possible outcomes and simply picking the outcome with the least delta x
and delta y:

case 1: R1 Moves R2 Moves
case 2: R1 Moves R2 Stops
case 3: R1 Stops R2 Moves
case 4: R1 Stops R2 Stops

Looking back at it, using the actual java awt Point class wasn't such a
good idea for this. Maybe I could have done this using four separate integers
instead, so that I wouldn't have to call Point.translate() to carry out the actual
translations, which are all highly likely to take much more execution time than a
simple increment/decrement. In the end, I ran out of time before finishing the solution
